LuxCC is a small compiler for a subset of the C programming language.
This subset is basically C89 (without floating-point numbers and some obsolete
or uncommon features) plus a few C99 features.

The compiler comes along with other tools that complete the development toolchain
(assemblers, linkers, and VMs).

LuxCC is able to compile itself and also other non-trivial programs (see the tests
for examples).

LuxCC currently targets:
  x86 32-bit
  x86 64-bit
  LuxVM 32-bit
  LuxVM 64-bit

The compiler is intended to run/target Linux only. Porting it to Windows would require
some considerable amount of work (I suppose porting it to other Unix-like OS should be
easier).

This is a one-man project developed mainly for educational purposes (and fun!); it is not
intended to replace any existing compiler/tool.

See the documentation at doc/index.html for usage information, internals, etc.
